## Carry Me Back Home(Blues Saraceno)
> Farewell my love
> We'll be together soon
> I'm resting with the angels
> They'll carry me to you
>  
> Realize my dear
> We'll see each other soon
> We'll meet up in the heavens
> I'll wait alone for you
>  
> Oh! I hear them say
> The angels are calling me back home
>  
> Good night, my dear
> Bestill your worried heart
> Keep me in your prayers
> We'll never be apart!
>  
> Take heed, sweet love
> You'll never be alone
> I'm watching from the heavens
> To keep you safe from harm
>  
> Oh! I hear them say
> The angels call to me!
> And when their trumpets play
> The angels will carry me back home!
>  
> Oh! I hear them say
> The angels call to me!
> And when their trumpets play
> The angels will carry me back home!
